					<p>When making such a leap in technology for our project we knew that a untitled_v4 type file system wasn't going to cut it. With 4 people working independently on different parts of a javascript and Java puzzle it just seems like them all important corner picies could go missing all too easily.</p>

<p>I had just used Github for the 2nd time at a hackathon and suggested we all learn the ropes and use it as our platform for version control.</p>

<p>Github also allows for some interesting stats, my favourite is the <a href="https://github.com/Sambillingham/six/graphs/punch-card">punchcard</a> some evidence of late night sessions I think. The <a href="https://github.com/Sambillingham/six/commits/master">commit</a> activity and <a href="https://github.com/Sambillingham/six/graphs/commit-activity">graphs</a> are cool but don't accurately show work produced by all team members, Phil especially, most of his code was passed to myself or Chris for manual implantation outside of the system and therefore he is heavily misrepresented. i really like being able to look back and see the diffrent stages the project has been through.</p>

<p>I only had to do one hard rest throughout the project which seemed pretty successful to me. Although there were some difficulties with everybody getting setup and understanding what to do, I think using Git increased our workflow as a team tremendously.</p>

<h2>jekyll/gh-pages Setup</h2>

<p>Github allows for a website to be built for each project using Github Pages, you can extend this slightly using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> to create a simple blog setup. I learned how to use Jekyll especially for this project so we could have our site hosted along with our code on Github. Phil designed and  developed the six website and I adapted it for use with Jekyll. i enjoyed Jekyll so much that i am going to re-design my personal site and migrate my posts over to a Jekyll platform asap.</p>
